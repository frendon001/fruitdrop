Fruit Drop is a community for home growers who want to share and trade their fruit and produce. This allows everyone in your neighborhoods to benefit from one another and get fresh, organic produce.

### Motivation

Neighbors were struggling with over-producing fruit trees in that there was quite a few waste, fruits were rotting on the ground, and it attracted quite a few critters. Fruit Drop was a way to not only solve this problem, it also benefitted the community.
